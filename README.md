######CSCI 5525 Machine Learning Assignments

This repository is a collection of all of my assignments from the course CSCI 5525: Machine Learning, taught by Nicholas Johnson in the fall of 2020. 
All homeworks were written in Python. Each folder is one homework assignment, but contains multiple runnable files as well as a README
describing how to run each file. The files are as follows:

#HW1/logisticRegression.py
This creates a logistic regression model on the Boston Housing dataset and tests using cross-validation.
