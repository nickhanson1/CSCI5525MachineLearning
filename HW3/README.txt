How to run: SVM_dual.py
  
	python neural_net.py
	Runs 30 epochs of the standard feed-forward network and displays the training accuracies and losses once done.



How to run: cnn.py


	python cnn.py
	Runs 50 epochs of the convolutional neural network with SGD optimizer and displays the training accuracies and losses once done.
	Then runs convolutional neural networks with optimizers SGD, Adam, and Adagrad using mini batch size 32, 64, 96, and 128. 
		Once finished, displays the total epochs taken for each network to converge.
